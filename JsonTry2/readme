This App if pretty much just a contacts app with a button that deletes all your contacts at once. I initially aimed to make a setlist randomizer that would allow the user to reorder songs they've inputed in various ways. I couldn't figure out how to do it with adding slides to a picker view so I just gave up. Lance helped me a bit with my code, and nothing should be broken.

Initial Goals:
- User should be able to add songs to a picker view
- User should be able to input a name and tags to describe the song
- these details should show up when the song is selected on the picker view
- The user should be able to remove songs
- The user should be able to sort songs by name
- The user should be able to sort song according to a string of tags

Goals for Project Turned in:
- User can input contacts, details and save
- User should be able to recall a list of all contacts added
- User should be able to delete all contacts
